      <h4>This multi-player game is prepared for android smartphones with
        chrome browser and
        internet connection. All players must be around
        the same table.
      </h4>
      <h4>The first player opens the link <br />bestia.dev/mem6<br />
        On the start page writes his nickname. Clicks `Start group`.
        On the next page is a qr code.
        Other players scan this qr code. It will open the browser
        on the game's webpage. Write your nicknames.
        Put all phones on the table near each other.
        All smartphones combined will be used as a single board game.
        The first player then chooses the type of game and clicks `Start
        game`.
        On the screen under the card grid are clear instructions which player
        plays and
        which waits. The green color calls for player action, the red means
        wait and the orange is informational. Player1 flips over two cards
        with two clicks. This cards can be on any smartphone. The cards are
        accompanied by sounds and text on the screen.
        If the cards match, they are left
        face up permanently and the player receives a point.
        If the cards don't match, they will be flipped back face down.
        Every player opens only two cards (to make the game faster).
        Then is the turn of the next player and he
        clicks to flip over his two cards. And the next and the next ...
        The game is over when all the cards are permanently face up.
        <br />Good luck and enjoy !<br /></h4>
