The classic approach is to react to en event and then programatically modify the dom. The problem is that it becomes quickly very complex. It is difficult to think (and test) an outcome after a long sequence of events.  \nIt is easier to think about the dom as a \"state machine\". The virtual dom is rendered from scratch every single time. The rendering depends only on the `state data` that is now in the data model (a struct called RootRenderingComponent). So changing this struct (data model) and scheduling the rendering, will result in a different vdom. No other complications around that. Pure simple. Easy to think, easy to test.     \nThen the original dom is modified to resemble the vdom. Modifying the dom is slow. To make it efficient, there is some smart caching and diff-ing in the library, to make the number of changes as small and efficient as possible.  \nIn this way we have a clear separation between data (RootRenderingComponent) and UI (code to render html virtual dom).
